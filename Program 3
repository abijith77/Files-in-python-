(c) Suppose a file contains student's records with each record containing name and age of a student. Write a program to read these records and display them in sorted order by name.

Program:
def read_and_sort_students(file_path):
    try:
        students = []
        
        # Read the file and parse the student records
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                name, age = line.strip().split(',')
                students.append((name.strip(), int(age.strip())))
        
        # Sort the students by name
        students.sort(key=lambda student: student[0])
        
        # Display the sorted records
        for name, age in students:
            print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file at path {file_path} was not found.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Error in parsing the file. Ensure it is in 'name,age' format.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
file_path = 'students.txt'  # Replace with the path to your file
read_and_sort_students(file_path)

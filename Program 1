(a) Write a program to read a file and display its contents along with line numbers
before each line.

Program:
def display_file_with_line_numbers(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            for line_number, line in enumerate(lines, start=1):
                print(f"{line_number}: {line}", end='')
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file at path {file_path} was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
file_path = 'example.txt'  # Replace with the path to your file
display_file_with_line_numbers(file_path)

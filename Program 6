 (f) Suppose an Employee object contains following details: employee code, employee name, date of joining, salary Write a program to serialize and deserialize this data

Program:
import pickle
from datetime import datetime

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, employee_code, employee_name, date_of_joining, salary):
        self.employee_code = employee_code
        self.employee_name = employee_name
        self.date_of_joining = date_of_joining
        self.salary = salary

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Employee({self.employee_code}, {self.employee_name}, {self.date_of_joining}, {self.salary})"

def serialize_employee(employee, filename):
    with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(employee, file)
    print(f"Employee data serialized to {filename}")

def deserialize_employee(filename):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
        employee = pickle.load(file)
    print(f"Employee data deserialized from {filename}")
    return employee

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an employee object
    employee = Employee("E001", "John Doe", datetime(2020, 1, 15), 50000)

    # File to store serialized data
    filename = 'employee_data.pkl'

    # Serialize the employee object
    serialize_employee(employee, filename)

    # Deserialize the employee object
    deserialized_employee = deserialize_employee(filename)
    print(deserialized_employee)

d) Write a program to copy contents of one file to another. While doing so replace all lowercase characters with their equivalent uppercase characters.

Program:
def copy_and_uppercase(source_file_path, destination_file_path):
    try:
        # Read the contents of the source file
        with open(source_file_path, 'r') as source_file:
            contents = source_file.read()
        
        # Convert contents to uppercase
        uppercase_contents = contents.upper()
        
        # Write the uppercase contents to the destination file
        with open(destination_file_path, 'w') as destination_file:
            destination_file.write(uppercase_contents)
        
        print(f"Contents of '{source_file_path}' have been copied to '{destination_file_path}' with all lowercase characters converted to uppercase.")
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"File not found: {e.filename}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
source_file_path = 'source.txt'  # Replace with the path to the source file
destination_file_path = 'destination.txt'  # Replace with the path to the destination file
copy_and_uppercase(source_file_path, destination_file_path)
Output:
File not found: source.txt

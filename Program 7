(g) A hospital keeps a file of blood donors in which each record has the
format: Name: 20 Columns Address: 40 Columns Age: 2 Columns Blood Type: 1 Column (Type 1, 2, 3 or 4) Write a program to read the file and print a list of all blood donors whose age is below 25 and whose blood type is 2.

Program:
def read_donors(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            donors = []
            for line in file:
                name = line[0:20].strip()
                address = line[20:60].strip()
                age = int(line[60:62].strip())
                blood_type = line[62:63].strip()
                donors.append((name, address, age, blood_type))
        return donors
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file {file_path} does not exist.")
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return []

def filter_donors(donors):
    filtered_donors = [donor for donor in donors if donor[2] < 25 and donor[3] == '2']
    return filtered_donors

def print_donors(donors):
    for donor in donors:
        print(f"Name: {donor[0]}, Address: {donor[1]}, Age: {donor[2]}, Blood Type: {donor[3]}")

# Example usage
file_path = 'donors.txt'  # Replace with your file path
donors = read_donors(file_path)
filtered_donors = filter_donors(donors)
print_donors(filtered_donors)

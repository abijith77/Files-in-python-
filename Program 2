b) Write a program to append the contents of one file at the end of another

Program:
def append_file_contents(source_file_path, destination_file_path):
    try:
        with open(source_file_path, 'r') as source_file:
            contents = source_file.read()

        with open(destination_file_path, 'a') as destination_file:
            destination_file.write(contents)
        
        print(f"Contents of '{source_file_path}' have been appended to '{destination_file_path}'.")
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"File not found: {e.filename}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
source_file_path = 'source.txt'  # Replace with the path to the source file
destination_file_path = 'destination.txt'  # Replace with the path to the destination file
append_file_contents(source_file_path, destination_file_path)

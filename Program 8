(h) Given a list of names of students in a class, write a program to store the names in a file on disk. Make a provision to display the n th name in the list, where n is read from the keyboard.

Program:
def store_names(names, file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
            for name in names:
                file.write(name + '\n')
        print(f"Names have been stored in {file_path}.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

def display_nth_name(file_path, n):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            if 1 <= n <= len(lines):
                print(f"The {n}th name in the list is: {lines[n-1].strip()}")
            else:
                print(f"Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and {len(lines)}.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file {file_path} does not exist.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    student_names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve']  # Replace with your list of student names
    file_path = 'students.txt'  # Replace with your desired file path
    
    # Store the names in the file
    store_names(student_names, file_path)
    
    # Read the nth name from the file
    try:
        n = int(input("Enter the position (n) of the name you want to display: "))
        display_nth_name(file_path, n)
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")
